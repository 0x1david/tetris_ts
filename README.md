# tetris_ts
** This is my first typescript project **
## DEPRECATED
** I was creating this app in order to learn typescript basics, practice vim motions and practice OOP a bit, I now feel like I've reached my goal To the extent I can in this project and I feel like finishing this project would no longer further my skills as affectively as I'd like and thus I've decided to move on without fininshing it **

## TAKEAWAYS
- I realised how amazing static typing can be, and honestly I'm  already starting to feel like I prefer it to dynamic typing.
- I i'm now *semi-intuitive* with *vim motions* and feel like I'm already much more productive than I was using VSCode
- I've learned the purpose of *interfaces and enums*. I've Reached a point of understanding in uses of the *observer and strategy patterns*
- I learned about *Model-View-Controller*

## NEXT SHORT-TERM GOALS
- Start Using Typescript to *create websites*, starting with front-end
- Learn shortcuts and usecases of the *various neovim plugins* (Telescope etc)
- Find places to practice further Strategy Patterns
